Telegraph - A simple one-to-many notification server written in Go.

The server listens on two ports -- one where the notifications are posted,
and one for the clients who wants to receive the notifications.
Notifications are broadcasted to all clients.


To start the server type the following:
./telegraph -l :9090 -L :9091

-l defines the port where notifications are posted.
-L defines the port where clients connect.


Clients connect using raw sockets.
Example: telnet localhost 9091


Notifications are posted using a HTTP POST request to /transmission
Example: curl http://localhost:9090/transmission -d "Hello World"
